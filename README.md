# Github Contri
Don't get distracted by contribution chart on GitHub. Color it all green!!<br>
A chrome extension which changes your contribution chart to green. Just a measure to prevent distraction.

## Motivation
Seeing the partial empty contribution chart on GitHub always bugged me. In order to fill it up I started making foolish commits which reduced my efficiency and focus for more important tasks.
In order to get over this distraction, and learn more about chrome extension I made this chrome extension which colors your entire Github Contribution page.

## Demo

## Installation
1. Clone the repository in your local file system.
```bash

2. Open chrome and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/)
3. Toggle on Developer mode
4. Select Load Unpacked
5. Navigate inside the clone repo and select OK
6. **Voila** The extension is loaded!


## Future Goals
